## Objective:
The goal of this project is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset to:

- Identify the most successful teams and players.
- Understand the key factors that influence the outcome of a match, such as toss decisions, venue, and individual player performances.
- Provide recommendations for companies looking to endorse teams or players based on their performance.

## Dataset:
